= Health Check - Fuse Booster

== Overview
This Red Hat Fuse booster demonstrates how to use the Kubernetes health check to determine whether a container is alive and ready to serve the traffic for the HTTP endpoints of an application.

The Health Check booster configures a `/health` HTTP endpoint that Kubernetes uses to issue HTTP requests. If the container is alive then the Health HTTP endpoint returns HTTP code 200 as a response and Kubernetes takes no further action. If the HTTP endpoint stops returning a 200 response, Kubernetes restarts the container pod.
                
== Deployment options

You can run this booster in the following modes:

* Single-node OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift Online at link:{launchURL}[]
* Standalone on your machine (although this mode does not include an automatic mechanism to restart your application when it stops)

The most effective way to use this booster is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This booster requires Java 8 JDK or later and Maven 3.3.x or later.


== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster
A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your booster there.

To deploy this booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem, for example to a folder called `my_openshift`.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted booster application (for example, `my_openshift/fuse-health-check-booster`):
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/fuse-health-check-booster
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `fuse-health-check-booster` application has started.

. On the project's `Overview` page, locate the URL for the `fuse-health-check-booster` application. The URL uses this form: `http://fuse-health-check-booster-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.

. Click the URL to access the greetings service application and follow the instructions on that page.

=== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images
To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Import base images in your newly created project (MY_PROJECT_NAME):
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc import-image {image-name-version} --from={image-registry}{image-prefix}{image-name-version} --confirm
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Popenshift -Djkube.generator.fromMode=istag -Djkube.generator.from=MY_PROJECT_NAME/{image-name-version}
----

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `fuse-health-check-booster` application has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, locate the URL for the `fuse-health-check-booster` application. The URL uses this form: `http://fuse-health-check-booster-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io`.

. Click the URL to access the greetings service application and follow the instructions on that page.

== Running the booster on OpenShift Online
To deploy this booster directly to OpenShift Online when you create the project at link:{launchURL}[]:

. Go to link:{launchURL}[].
. At the *Deployment step*, select *Use OpenShift Online*.
. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new *Health Check* project by using the *Fuse* runtime.

NOTE: As part of the process of creating this booster, link:{launchURL}[] sets up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your single-node OpenShift cluster or OpenShift Online web console.

== Running the booster standalone on your machine

IMPORTANT: When running the booster in this mode, since it is not running in a managed container platform, the application does not automatically restart when it stops. The most effective way to use this booster is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

To run this booster as a standalone project on your local machine:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.
. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. Run the services:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
. Go to link:http://localhost:8080[] and then follow the instructions on that page.
